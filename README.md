Microsoft Azure Developer Immersion source files.

The source files here support the Azure Developer Immersion that was run in late 2015 and early 2015 by Microsoft as part of the Microsoft Azure Tour. The content was created by MCW Technologies for Microsoft.

You can find all the docs in PDF format at [the rGroup site](http://rgroup.us).

The files here are available there in a ZIP filem or you can pull from this GitHub repo and provide feedback if you like.

If you go through the walkthroughs with this starter code, you�ll take an existing responsive web site and lift & shift it to the Azure cloud, along with its SQL Server database and other components. The website is a personal social site where you can invite friends and family to share updates, photos, and videos from your desktop or mobile device with support for secure authenticated logins, searching, and more. Using Visual Studio 2015 Update 1, Visual Studio Team Services, and Microsoft Azure you will make it your own. At the end, you can use it, along with all the code and data so you can continue to extend and personalize it.

The walkthroughs provides hands-on experience updating the site to run on Azure App Service. You�ll get to move it to an Azure Web App framework, use Visual Studio Team Services including Git repos, work item tracking and team builds. You�ll work with Redis Cache and Azure Search. And because the web site supports both desktop and mobile browsers, you�ll learn also how to integrate notifications with Azure Notification Hubs.
